# HRTF upsampling with a generative adversarial network using a gnomonic equiangular projection noise processing extensions

This code is an extension of the code found here: https://github.com/ahogg/HRTF-upsampling-with-a-generative-adversarial-network-using-a-gnomonic-equiangular-projection
The original code base was part of the following research paper:

A. O. T. Hogg, M. Jenkins, H. Liu, I. Squires, S. J. Cooper and L. Picinali: HRTF upsampling with a generative adversarial network using a gnomonic equiangular projection. *In: Proc. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing (submitted)*.

Additions to the code have been marked with ****....Added Code*... and ****...End Added Code*...

In addition, this repository contains Jupyter Notebooks used for noise generation, graphs, and another Python file used for localization calcuations that again extends the original code.
